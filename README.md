- 👋 Hi, I’m @socramteix, Master in Mechatronic Systems by University of Brasília, enthusiastic about new technologies and always looking for learning something new. 
- 💞️ As hobbies I’m interested in developing projects in the Embedded Systems area using arduino, raspiberry and other prototyping platforms. Specially for 
Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, home automation, automation for 🌱 precision agriculture and development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). 
- 👀 Currently I'm working as a systems developer at the Brazil's Ministry of Economy in the Startup project ✨Gov.br✨ automating nacional citizen services.
